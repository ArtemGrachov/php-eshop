# PHP e-Shop
## Educational project

I developed this project to study PHP, MySQL and MVC implementation for PHP.

This is an e-Shop with the following features:

- products
- product taxons
- cart
- checkout processing
- file upload
- admin authentication
- admin panel
- admin users
- internationalization

All the project is written from scratch, third-party libs used only for front-end path (Bulma.css and jQuery).
